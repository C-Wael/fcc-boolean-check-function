FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures - Certification Lab

## Description

In this lab, you will build a function that checks if a value is classified as a boolean primitive.

Boolean primitives are `true` and `false`.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

## User Stories

1. You should have a function called `booWho` that receives one argument.

2. If the argument received is a boolean primitive, the function should return `true`.

3. If the argument is any other value, the function should return `false`.
